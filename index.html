        <!-• Biography -->
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my professional website. I am Kevin Moore, and I am honored to share my journey and expertise in the realm of global education and business. With over 20 years of experience, I have dedicated my career to advancing educational practices and fostering international collaboration.</p>
        <p>I hold a Ph.D. in Education with a TESOL minor from the European Global School • University in France, along with master's degrees in Social Sciences and TESOL from prestigious institutions. My academic background has laid a strong foundation for my work in specialized language instruction, particularly in the field of medical English within the pharmaceutical sector.</p>
        <p>During my tenure at Chengdu Medical University in China, I made significant contributions to the development of medical English programs. Additionally, I dedicated five years of service to Mianyang Teachers College and Southwest Petroleum University in Chengdu, further honing my expertise in English language training and educational practices.</p>
        <p>Beyond the classroom, my research extends to the scientific community, where I have conducted impactful studies on cancer cells. As an active member of the Endocrine Society, I have contributed to advancing knowledge in hormonal systems and endocrine-related conditions. My
diverse experiences in both academic and scientific communities have positioned me at the intersection of language education and medical sciences.</p>
        <p>Fluency in English, Mandarin Chinese, German, Hebrew, and Vietnamese has been instrumental in my success in spearheading international student exchanges and online education initiatives. My linguistic capabilities have enabled me to foster educational
innovation and enhance global understanding across linguistic, financial, and security disciplines.</p>
        <p>In the ever-evolving field of healthcare communication, I stay connected with leading minds in medicine and research through my membership with DocMatter, a collaborative community that fosters clinical dialogue and innovation.
Additionally, I am an engaged member of various professional organizations, reflecting my dedication to international collaboration and interdisciplinary
research.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to continuing to contribute to the fields of education, language instruction, and medical sciences, and to fostering global understanding through my work.</p>
